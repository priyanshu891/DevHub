				<h2>What is a bug and issue tracking tool?</h2>
				<p>
					Bug and issue tracking software helps software teams find, record and track bugs in their software. It's important that everyone
					on your team is able to find and record bugs, and even more important, assign them to the right team members at the
					right time. A great bug and issue tracker gives your team a single view of all items in the backlog, regardless of whether
					the work item is a bug or a task related to a new feature development. Having a single source of truth of all issue
					types helps teams prioritize against their big picture goals, while continually delivering value to their customers.

				<h2>File Sharing</h2>
				<p>
					Every project runs on many sources of information like documents, spreadsheets, video clips, images and more. Often these
					files are present in different places and on different computers. With DevHub BugTracker, put all your files in a central
					place for your team and make their life easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upload and manage different file types like *.doc, *.ppt, *.xls, *.zip, *.jpg all in one place.

				<h2>Capture bugs</h2>
				<p>
					Capture bugs anywhere in your software projects with DevHub Software. Once you've identified a bug, create an issue and add
					all relevant details, including: descriptions, severity level, screenshots, version and more. Issues can represent anything
					from a software bug, a project task, to a leave request form and each unique issue type can have it's own custom workflow.
